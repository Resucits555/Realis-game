The main idea of this project is making a simulation with all the properties such as temperature, pressure, speed and physical concepts like bending materials, crumbling objects, explosions and more.

The sim is a cellular-automata: a big map of cells with relations to each other. Cells could be assigned to objects to create "moving solids", a fairly hard concept to make in such enviroment. To give free way for the imagination of users, there should be a built in "element creator" to create materials with all kinds of properties needed, but also standart ones.
