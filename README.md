The main idea of this project is making a simulation with all the properties such as temperature, pressure, speed and physical concepts like bending materials, crumbling objects, explosions and more.

The sim is a cellular-automata: a big map of cells with relations to each other. Cells could be assigned to objects to create "moving solids", a fairly hard concept to make in such enviroment. To give free way for the imagination of users, there should be a built in "element creator" to create materials with all kinds of properties needed, but also standart ones.


To compile you need to:
1. Create a new folder build
2. Go to that folder in the console
3. Type "cmake .."
4. 
When finished, you can use Visual studio to compile the project through the solution
