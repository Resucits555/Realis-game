The simulation has different elements to generalise properties of cells. There are standart ones given but you can also define your own (WIP). The properties are:
- name: how the element is called. Max. 7 characters
- color: rgba 0-255
- elasticity: how much force is given to the surrounding cells rather than the force direction
- hardness: how much force the cell gives directly to the object/max. threshold

The simulation is a grid of cells. Each cell consists of:
- origin: cell position if there is no pressure aplied
- type: element of cell
- myobject: assigned object

To make "moving solids" possible, the sim has objects, which could be described as a connection of cells. It contains:
- position: position of the mid cell
- rotation: general rotation in comparison to original. NOTE: A full rotation is 252°*, not 360° (marked with *, 7/10)
- linVelocity: linear general velocity
- angVelocity: angular general velocity in °*
